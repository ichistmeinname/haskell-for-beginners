# haskell-for-beginners

Resources from the course "Advanced Programming" about functional programming using Haskell.

While working with Haskell we will always use the `GADTSystax` language extension for didactic purposes.
To enable the language extension insert `{-# LANGUAGE GADTSyntax #-}` at the top of every Haskell file.
